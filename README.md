# Journey planner for the London Underground

## Overview
This project, developed for COMP1828 Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures at the University of Greenwich, aims to build an efficient journey planner for the London Underground using advanced graph-based algorithms.

## Features 
- **Shortest Path Calculation** â€“ Computes optimal routes between stations.
- **Time & Stop-Based Routes** â€“ Finds paths based on journey time (minutes) or number of stops.
- **Graph Algorithms** â€“ Implements **Dijkstra's algorithm** and **BFS** for route optimization.
- **Data Processing** â€“ Uses real-world London Underground data.
- **Algorithm Complexity Analysis** â€“ Compares empirical execution time with theoretical complexity.
- **Histogram Visualization** â€“ Displays journey duration distributions.
- **Network Disruption Simulation** â€“ Analyzes the impact of closing certain routes.
